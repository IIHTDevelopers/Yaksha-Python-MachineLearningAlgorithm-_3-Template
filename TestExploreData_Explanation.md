# Explanation of TestExploreData Test Behavior

## Updated Test to Check for Specific Output

We've modified the `test_explore_data` function in `test_functional.py` to check for specific output related to loan amount:

```python
def test_explore_data(self):
    """
    Test case for explore_data() function.
    """
    try:
        # Redirect stdout to capture print output
        captured_output = io.StringIO()
        sys.stdout = captured_output
        
        # Load data and call the function
        df = load_and_prepare_data("loan_dataset.csv")
        explore_data(df)
        
        # Reset stdout
        sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__
        
        # Check if any output was produced
        output = captured_output.getvalue()
        if output and "loan amount" in output.lower():
            self.test_obj.yakshaAssert("TestExploreData", True, "functional")
            print("TestExploreData = Passed")
        else:
            self.test_obj.yakshaAssert("TestExploreData", False, "functional")
            print("TestExploreData = Failed")
    except Exception as e:
        self.test_obj.yakshaAssert("TestExploreData", False, "functional")
        print(f"TestExploreData = Failed | Exception: {e}")
```

This change ensures that the test will fail if:
1. The function raises an exception (caught in the except block)
2. The function doesn't produce any output
3. The function's output doesn't contain the phrase "loan amount"

## How the Test Works Now

The test now has two ways to fail:
1. If an exception is thrown (like the `NotImplementedError` we added to the skeleton code)
2. If the function doesn't produce the expected output

And one way to pass:
- If the function runs without errors AND produces output that includes the phrase "loan amount"

## Implementing the Function

To make the test pass, you'll need to implement the `explore_data` function to analyze the loan amount distribution and display key statistics. The function should:
1. Not raise any exceptions
2. Print information about the loan amount (ensuring the phrase "loan amount" appears in the output)

## Conclusion

With these changes, all tests will fail until the functions are properly implemented. This provides a clear indication of what needs to be implemented and ensures that the tests validate the correct behavior.
